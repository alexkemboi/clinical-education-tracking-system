Project Overview
The project is created using Create React App, which is a popular tool for quickly setting up a React application.

Available Scripts
In the project directory, you can run the following scripts using npm:

npm start: Runs the app in development mode and opens it in the browser at http://localhost:3000.

npm test: Launches the test runner in interactive watch mode for running tests.

npm run build: Builds the app for production by creating an optimized and minified version in the build folder.

npm run eject: This is a one-way operation that allows full control over the build tool and configuration by copying the configuration files and dependencies into the project. It should be used with caution as there is no way to revert the changes made by ejecting.

Note: The npm start command should be used during development, while npm run build is suitable for production deployments.

Please refer to the official Create React App documentation for more detailed information on using these scripts and customizing your React application.
